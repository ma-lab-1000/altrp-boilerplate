# Initialization Protocol (Start)

## Overview
An interactive startup and readiness check for the Architect, beginning with environment verification and the selection of the primary protocol.
The .env and database.db files are located in the external storage directory, not in the project folder. Run the dev server with hot-reload in the background via make dev.

## Steps
1.  **Environment Verification (Pre-flight Check)**
   - Read the external storage path from the `config.json` file (key `storage`). If the file is missing, run to **[create it](../../scripts/project-init.ps1)**.
   - Verify that the directory at this path exists.
   - Verify that the `.env` file and the database file (`.dev-agent.db`) exist within it.
   - **On failure:** Abort execution and report the specific issue (e.g., "Storage directory not found" or ".env file is missing").
   - **On success:** Print the following message to the chat: **"Connection to the database and environment established."**

2.  **Request Initial Protocol**
   - **Ask the user:** "Which protocol should be executed first: `Workspace Synchronization` or `goals-enforcer`?".
   - Await the user's choice to proceed.

3.  **Activate Core Directives**
   - **Language:** Code, comments, and documentation are strictly in English. Chat communication is in Russian.
   - **Stack:** Development is done exclusively in TypeScript for the Bun runtime.
   - **Style:** All communication and documentation must be maximally concise, with no redundancy.
   - **File System:** Upon any file addition or deletion, this change must be immediately reflected in the **[Structure](../../docs/structure.md)** file.
   - **Tooling:** All terminal operations are performed only through **[Makefile](../../Makefile)**.
   - Do not create new files or folders, and do not delete files or folders without user consent.
   - We are using PowerShell for Windows, so please do not use &&. Instead, use a semicolon (;) for sequential commands and follow other PowerShell syntax rules to ensure correct execution.

## Workflow Protocols
- **[Workspace Synchronization](./workspace-synchronization.md)** - To synchronize your local workspace before starting work.
- **[Goals Enforcer](./goals-enforcer.md)** - To analyze a new task directive and begin a development workflow.
