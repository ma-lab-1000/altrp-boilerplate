# Performance Optimization

This guide covers performance optimization techniques for LND Boilerplate.

## Image Optimization

### Using Next.js Image Component

Always use the `next/image` component for optimized images:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/path/to/image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  priority={isAboveFold}
/>
```

### Image Formats

- Use WebP for better compression
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers
- Consider using responsive images

## Code Splitting

### Dynamic Imports

Use dynamic imports for code splitting:

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>
})
```

### Route-based Splitting

Next.js automatically splits code by route, but you can optimize further:

- Lazy load components
- Use React.lazy for client-side components
- Implement proper loading states

## Bundle Optimization

### Tree Shaking

Ensure your imports are tree-shakeable:

```jsx
// Good
import { Button } from '@lnd/ui/components'

// Avoid
import * as UI from '@lnd/ui/components'
```

### Bundle Analysis

Use bundle analyzers to identify optimization opportunities:

```bash
bun run analyze
```

## Caching Strategies

### Static Generation

Use static generation when possible:

```jsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  // Generate static pages at build time
}
```

### ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

For dynamic content that doesn't change frequently:

```jsx
export const revalidate = 3600 // Revalidate every hour
```

## Monitoring

### Performance Metrics

Monitor key performance metrics:

- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- First Input Delay (FID)

### Tools

- Lighthouse for performance audits
- Web Vitals for real user monitoring
- Bundle analyzers for bundle size optimization
